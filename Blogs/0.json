We\u2019ve been makin\u2019 VOLUME 1!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2><b>\"What have you guys been doing? IT\u2019S BEEN A YEAR!\"</b></h2>\n<p>Well\u2026 Game development\u2026 Yeah\u2026 Game development.<br><br>\nIn all seriousness, it really does take a while! No idea comes out of the metaphorical brain womb fully formed. While we\u2019ve been mostly silent, we can assure you that we\u2019ve been developing DREAMTONE almost every day for the past year! We\u2019ve been working on VOLUME 1, the first episode. It serves as an introduction to DREAMTONE, introducing its world and characters. Here\u2019s a snippet of the writing:</p>\n\n\n\n<center><figure>\n<img src=\"https://file.garden/aGu7TFPaUhaQRZyD/dreamtone%20blogs/progress%20report%201/snippet.png\">\n<figcaption>This sequence occurs while walking in the subway</figcaption>\n</figure></center>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve been revising DREAMTONE\u2019s art to fit with the comic book aesthetic we envisioned. Specifically, we\u2019ve gone back and replaced a lot of the minimally animated cutscenes with actual comic book styled panels. Take a look:</p>\n\n<center><div class=\"big-figure-container\">\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://file.garden/aGu7TFPaUhaQRZyD/dreamtone%20blogs/progress%20report%201/before_comic.png\" width=\"300\">\n<figcaption>This is before</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://file.garden/aGu7TFPaUhaQRZyD/dreamtone%20blogs/progress%20report%201/after_comic.png\" width=\"300\">\n<figcaption>This is after</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></center><br>\n\n<p>Oh, and we also changed Nathan\u2019s hair color, look!</p>\n\n<center><div class=\"figure-container\">\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://file.garden/aGu7TFPaUhaQRZyD/dreamtone%20blogs/progress%20report%201/before_hair.png\">\n<figcaption>This is before</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://file.garden/aGu7TFPaUhaQRZyD/dreamtone%20blogs/progress%20report%201/after_hair.png\">\n<figcaption>This is after</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></center><br>\n\n<center><div class=\"figure-container\">\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://file.garden/aGu7TFPaUhaQRZyD/dreamtone%20blogs/progress%20report%201/way_before.png\"\">\n<figcaption>And this is from WAY before</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></center><br><br>\n\n<hr>\n<h2><b>\"So, how playable is it?\"</b></h2>\n<p>The prologue is playable from start to finish, but isn\u2019t fully polished. Since the prologue is half of VOLUME 1, that means VOLUME 1 is 50% done!... But, again, not fully polished. We\u2019re not going to preemptively toss out any numbers or promise anything, but we\u2019re confident in where we\u2019re at. Sorry!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><b>\"...Oh...Really?\"</b></h2>\n<p>Please take this writeup as an apology!</p>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 style=\"font-family: Posten;\"><b>STEP INTO THE STRANGE WORLD OF DREAMTONE!</b></h2>\n<p><b>DREAMTONE</b> is an episodic traditional RPG that whimsically harkens back to the long-gone days of the mid-1980s.\nJoin our protagonists <b>Nathan Bloom</b> and his older brother <b>Neil</b>.\nAfter Neil drags Nathan to a party in the woods gone wrong, they find themselves caught in the throes of a conspiracy that\u2019s rocking America!\nForced to make friends with a rotating cast of weirdos, they road-trip across Michigan.\nOur accidental misfit heroes will encounter bombastic gangsters, ancient demons, and creatures straight out of your Saturday morning nightmares!</p>\n\n<p>Simply put, <b>DREAMTONE</b> is a turn-based RPG packed with old-school charm, brain-bending battles, and a heavy dose of the unexpected.<br>\nThink you\u2019ve seen everything? Think again!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 style=\"font-family: Posten;\"><b>PUMPED-UP BATTLES!</b></h2>\n<p><b>DREAMTONE</b> throws you into complex battles where timing is everything.\nFor example, if you press X just as the enemy flashes, you can launch a counter attack!\nCounter-attacks negate all damage the enemy would've done, and even allow you to hit back!</p>\n<center><img style=\"width:60%;\" src=\"https://file.garden/aGu7TFPaUhaQRZyD/dreamtone%20blogs/progress%20report%201/countering.gif\"></center>\n<p>And not every move is a one-tap trigger pull.\nSpecial attacks will give you unique mini-games.\nThe one down below is Nathan\u2019s Zap ability. Tap repeatedly to charge, and then watch it spin up!\nThe more you tap, the more powerful the attack will get, but also the more ENERGY it\u2019ll use!</p>\n<center><img style=\"width:60%;\" src=\"https://file.garden/aGu7TFPaUhaQRZyD/dreamtone%20blogs/progress%20report%201/shoot.gif\"></center>\n\n<p>Sometimes, you\u2019ll get lucky and your attacks will strike critically and deal extra damage!\nBut don\u2019t think you\u2019re the only one who can get lucky \u2018round here!\nEven the enemies can strike critically, and if you\u2019re super unlucky, they\u2019ll throw a chain of critical attacks your way!</p>\n<center><img style=\"width:60%;\" src=\"https://file.garden/aGu7TFPaUhaQRZyD/dreamtone%20blogs/progress%20report%201/bam.gif\"></center>\n<p>Chain together attacks, unlock new abilities, and swap out strategies on the <i>fly</i>.\nDon\u2019t forget, it\u2019s brains over brawns!\nTrick your opponents and even sidestep battles altogether if you\u2019re clever enough!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 style=\"font-family: Posten;\"><b>SWITCHIN\u2019 IT UP!</b></h2>\n<p>Have you ever wanted to walk a mile in another person\u2019s shoes?\nGreat! In <b>DREAMTONE</b>, you can switch between your party members to get a different perspective on the world.\nEvery character has their own dialogue and little interactions, so leave no stone unturned if you want to see everything a character has to offer!\nWhen you switch it up, you gain access to a party member\u2019s overworld ability.\nThis allows you to perform a special action exclusive to that character.</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\n\n\n<center><div class=\"big-figure-container\">\n<figure>\n<figcaption style=\"color: black;\"><p>\nWant to break a log? Switch to Neil.</p>\n<img src=\"https://file.garden/aGu7TFPaUhaQRZyD/dreamtone%20blogs/progress%20report%201/switch.gif\">\n\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n<figcaption style=\"color: black;\"><p>\nWant to charm an NPC out of the scene?

I see what you\u2019re doing!\nStop hoarding every item, you\u2019ll become encumbered!\nWhen you carry too many items, you become over-encumbered.\nYou\u2019ll lose some speed in the overworld and perform badly in battles while overencumbered.\nSo, make sure to tidy up every now and again!</p>\n\n<center><img style=\"width:60%;\" src=\"https://file.garden/aGu7TFPaUhaQRZyD/dreamtone%20blogs/progress%20report%201/encumberedpart2.gif\"></center>\n\n\n<p>Fret not though, not every item will take up a slot in your inventory.\nItems in DREAMTONE can stack on top of each other.</p>\n\n<p>\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Yes, yes, I hear you!
