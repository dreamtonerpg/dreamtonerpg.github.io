Shortly after we\nannounced we\u2019d be ceasing the scheduled updates we started to receive a lot more\nquestions than usual, so tonight we\u2019ll be answering some of them, and sneaking in some relevant images. </p><br><p>Without further ado, here\u2019s our answers!</p><br><p><b>Q: The maps look pretty big. Will we be able to run?</b>\nA: Yes! You hold down the cancel button for a moment, and then release to dash. It works just like it does in Mother 3.\n</p><center><figure><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/0iheOxR.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0iheOxR.gif\" alt=\"image\"></a><figcaption>And just like in Mother 3, getting sick or hurt prevents you from running.</figcaption></figure></center><br><p><b>Q: Are any new PSI abilities being added?</b></p><p>A: Yes! Though we aren\u2019t quite ready to show off all the new stuff, we can say that a lot of our focus on new abilities is aimed towards support abilities and the countering of support abilities - and this goes for enemies as well. However, even returning PSI powers will be getting attention and additional effects.</p><center><figure><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/YxYPLdB.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/YxYPLdB.gif\" alt=\"image\"></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></center><br><p><b>Q: What kinds of things are returning? Is (particular enemy, song, character) returning?</b></p><p>A: If it\u2019s been in every official Mother game, it\u2019s a safe bet to assume we\u2019re including\nit. Things like flowers, sidewalks, gangsters, rats, Pollyana, birds, dogs, boys, girls,\netc etc. However, previous characters are not returning. This is in our FAQ - No Ness, no\nPorky, no Giygas, no Lucas, not even Ninten. Mr. Saturn is a returning element, but as\nthere is no one Mr. Saturn character, this doesn\u2019t really count. Gangsters though,\ngangsters are coming back.</p><center><figure><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/M547rd7.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/M547rd7.gif\" alt=\"image\"></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></center><br><b>Q: What hardware is compatible with Mother 4?</b><p>A: The game will run on <b>Windows, macOS, and Linux</b> desktop and laptop computers. We can\u2019t guarantee support on any other platform. It\u2019s compatible with most computer gamepads - be they USB or otherwise.</p><br><p><b>Q: A lot of Nintendo fan games have been taken down recently. Has Nintendo\ncontacted you or taken any action against you yet? What will you do if they do?</b></p><p>A: So far we haven\u2019t heard anything! If we do, we\u2019ll do everything in our power to make sure you guys get a game even if we have to release under a different name after removing any copyrighted material and systems.  Our goal is to respect and pay tribute to the Mother series, not fight the people who made it.</p><br><b>Q: Why are you still calling the game Mother 4? Why not Step Mother or Mother Gaiden, or an original title?</b><p>A: This is a pretty common question - especially lately with the above concern taken into account, and we absolutely understand why. The Mother series is precious to a lot of people, and that includes us. We\u2019re not out to fill in any blanks or any any calls to action or assume any duties because this will never be <i>the</i> Mother 4. That was never the intention. </p><p>When Mother 3 first released, a lot of people played through the game without even knowing Japanese, instead relying on the expressive characters and setting to tell the story. Even before they read the story in English, people were wondering what would - or even could - come next. In this way Mother games seem particularly strong\u2026 People don\u2019t just play them, through fan art, comics, costumes, ideas, theories, communities, even games, they seem to play <i>with</i> Mother games. </p><p>We\u2019re doing the same thing, because all of us are still in love with the world and characters we grew up playing with. We still wonder what could come next (relatively speaking), and our version of Mother 4 presents just one possibility, expressed through us playing with the setting that has been laid out ahead of time.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, just making this game has been its own reward, even if it winds up being another dead leaf in the playground of the Mother universe.</p> \n<br><p>Of course if people wind up liking our answer, that\u2019s just fine too.</p><b>Q: You guys are taking too long!</b><p>A: That\u2019s why we appreciate your patience so much. We\u2019re hobbyists and amateurs, but we try our best even if it doesn\u2019t always go the best. For example, this post is about a week late - and we can\u2019t say anything much other than we\u2019re glad you\u2019re still here to read it. </p><br><b>Q: So what about updates?</b><p>A: While we\u2019re always working on the game, we definitely understand the anxiousness when we go quiet or miss a deadline. We\u2019re still trying new things, and will continue to on this front. </p><br><p>We\u2019ll get it sooner rather than later - and in the meantime we absolutely appreciate your patience here, too. You\u2019re really great to us!</p><br><center><figure><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/FkBYiCw.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/FkBYiCw.png\" alt=\"image\"></a><figcaption>We really appreciate it!</figcaption></figure></center><br><p>Really, thank you, from the bottom of all of our hearts.</p><br><p>We\u2019ll see you next update! We\u2019ll be going into a little more detail on one of those first three questions then.</p>",
